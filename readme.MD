This repository contains the implementation of CLAHE histogram equalization
algorithms that can be applied to a set of 8 bit/ 16 bit, RGB/gray scale images. 
It also support multithreading using OpenMP for extracting all the images from a 
directory, apply CLAHE algorithm and save them in another directory.
